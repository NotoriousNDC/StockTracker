# StockTracker
StockTracker uses Python and Selenium Webscraping to track stock trades by members of Congress, calculate their success, and return a spreadsheet of the trades. Click on each trade's respective link to get more trade-specific information. When a trade is colored red, it means that there is overlap between the GICS sector of the stock and the committees that the member of congress are on.
