# StockTracker
StockTracker uses Python and Selenium Webscraping to track stock trades by members of Congress, calculate their success, and return a spreadsheet of the trades. Click on each trade's respective link to get more trade-specific information. When a trade is colored red, it means that there is overlap between the GICS sector of the stock and the committees that the member of congress are on.

Modules to install:
Pandas, yfinance, selenium, webdriver-manager, chromedriver-py, chromedriver, styleframe

All of these modules can be installed via pip using the names above. All other modules used in the program should be installed by default when you install Python.
